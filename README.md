# The Human Side of Supply Chain Management

Moving packages around is easy when there is only one item being moved around, however, when there is constraints on scale, time, quality, security, and cost the problem of supply chain gets complicated.
When there is a need to have a lot of packages being moved to many locations all at once, scale takes into account. 
When there is timeline, it's easier to know familiar routes in order to cut time down.
With quality, handling packages like pizza and glass requires delicate hands so jamming packages down in a truck doesn't make the cut.
The best security is with people that are trusted within the organization.
Combining these four ideas above, cost can vary depending on what concept is required of the job at hand.
At the end of the day, none of the above matters when employees are treated like robots and while robots can be useful, it can only be specialized enough to handle a small amount of one of these areas. 
Humans need a sense of freedom to explore each of the four concepts - scale, time, quality, and security. 
How is it possible that a single person can have all four of these qualities? 
A single person can set an example for the rest of the employees. 
With that being said, quality requires higher cost and it is not found in quantity.
At ground level, these ideas are nice but they require bodies to so.
Moving a body requires proper warmup consistently and doing it consistently prevents injuries on the ground.
Moving heavy packages takes a lot of intensity that a body can only do every so often a day.
Moving a body also requires proper hydration to keep motivation up.
Moving a body requires nutrition to consistently provide quality service to the customers.
Moving packages around becomes laborious, tedious and mundane, however it provides room for the mind to wander around if an individual chooses to do so.
The value of a single individual moving packages around is underestimated in the world of supply chain.
